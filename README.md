# LaTeX Template Documents

Within this repository are various example documents for common document types you might make with LaTeX. The templates have then each been used to make a guide document for the corresponding template, listing the different parameters that one should edit and the custom commands created for that document.

## The Guides

## General Guide to LaTeX

There is also a very useful guide to LaTeX that, while somewhat long, can be very helpful to read if you're new to LaTeX.

## Using the Templates

To use the templates you can either 
- download the files and edit them in your IDE of choice,
- download the template folder as a .zip and upload that to Overleaf or
- [make a copy of the repository in your own GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/duplicating-a-repository) and then [open the repository in Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/Using_Git_and_GitHub) by linking your GitHub account to your Overleaf account.
