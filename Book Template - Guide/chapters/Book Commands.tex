            \verb+\ToC+\\
            The Table of Contents in the book class tends to misbehave a little more so this command sets up the Table of Contents, inserts it and adds a hyperlink target \verb+ToC+ so that the header can link back to it.

            \verb+\setChapterFormatArabic+\\
            Includes the code from \verb+Chapter Type 1.tex+ which configures the chapter title formatting with different text and number formatting. Edit the file to edit what the command does.

            \verb+\setChapterFormatRoman+\\
            Includes the code from \verb+Chapter Type 2.tex+ which configures the chapter title formatting with different text and number formatting. Edit the file to edit what the command does.

            \verb+\setChapterFormatAppendix+\\
            Includes the code from \verb+Chapter Type Appendices.tex+ which configures the chapter title formatting to just say Appendices. Edit the file to edit what the command does.

            \verb+\setChapterFormatReferences+\\
            Includes the code from \verb+Chapter Type References.tex+ which configures the chapter title formatting to just say References. Edit the file to edit what the command does.

        \section{Other Useful Commands}

            \verb+\setcounter{chapter}{<n>}+\\
            Any level above \verb+<n>+ isn't numbered, where chapters are level 0, so setting \verb+<n>+=-1 means nothing will be numbered, 0 only chapters, etc.

            \verb+\frontmatter+ and \verb+\mainmatter+\\
            Sets up the page numbers and page formatting. For instance the \verb+\chapter{}+ command has different behaviour in the front matter compared to the main matter.

            \verb+\setcounter{chapter}{<n>}+\\
            Sets the current chapter number to \verb+<n>+. Helpful if you want specific numbering.
